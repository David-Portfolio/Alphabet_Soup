The purpose of this project is to use machine learning techniques to support future funding decisions from Alphabet Soup. The provided csv file aggregating over 34,000 organizations that have previously received funding is the data source for our deep learning model. After pre-processing the data, optimizing and running the model, we have achieved target performance of 75% accuracy. Additional layer details and graph for reference:

* Layer 1: 20 neurons
* Layer 2: 15 neurons
* Layer 3: 10 neurons
* Layer 4: 5 neurons
* Layer 5: 1 neurons



*Note: it is assumed that for column "IS_SUCCESSFUL" that "0" = "N" and "1" = "Y", and for column "STATUS" that "0" = "Not Active" and "1" = "Active".
